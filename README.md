# Admin System

Welcome to the Admin System Repository! This system allows users to log in and provides administrative capabilities to manage user information (add, delete, update). This project is built using Vue.js for the frontend and Java Spring Boot with MyBatis Plus for the backend functionality. MySQL is used to store data, and Redis serves as a caching mechanism for login data.
